# Popular Movies - Stage 2

You need an MovieDB API key to use this app. Go to https://www.themoviedb.org/ to create your account and apply for an API key.

Then create a gradle.properties file in the root directory of the project with the following content:


```javascript
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536m
MovieDbApiKey=ENTER-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE
```
After compiling the project it should work as intended.
